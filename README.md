# JNotes
JNotes is a simple text editor I'm developing to explore the challenges that arise when building something seemingly simple, like a text editor. The inspiration for this project came from Austin Z. Henley's article, [Challenging projects every programmer should try](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html), which highlights various data structures I might use and other interesting key concepts.

Furthermore, I want to incorporate a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests to ensure thorough coverage and improve my testing skills.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement a custom "text area" without relying on `JTextArea` from the Swing library or similar components.
- [ ] Implement of text cursor with its behaviours.
